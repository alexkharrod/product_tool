## Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Documentation drift | High | Medium | Daily automated checks |
| Knowledge silos | Medium | High | Cross-team review process |
| Legacy system integration | Low | Critical | Fallback API endpoints |
